# Zora Developer Tools

The Zora Developer Tools is a suite of typescript libraries and utilities that simplify interacting with the Zora protocol contracts.

## Protocol Deployments Package

The [Protocol Deployments](./protocol-deployments/guide) package provides contract abis, deployed addresses, and typescript types for the Zora Contracts. These bundled configs and abis can be used in conjunction with wagmi or viem to interact with the Zora contracts in typescript without needing to write any solidity.

```ts twoslash
import {
  protocolRewardsABI,
  zoraCreator1155FactoryImplABI,
  protocolRewardsAddress,
  zoraCreator1155FactoryImplAddress,
} from "@zoralabs/protocol-deployments";
```

## Protocol SDK

The [Protocol SDK](./protocol-sdk/getting-started) is a typescript package that simplifies interacting with the Zora protocol by generating required transactions for our contracts.

```ts twoslash
import { zora } from "viem/chains";
import { http, createPublicClient } from "viem";
import { createMintClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";

const tokenAddress = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890";
const tokenId = 1n;
const mintToAddress = "0x71907e8Ae7aeFb58ceC8eb46DAf4fc78c29E5173";
const quantityToMint = 1;
const minterAccount = "0xCb8454D64AFeB46455cB4847C53279F6cdCbFb5e";

const publicClient = createPublicClient({
  // this will determine which chain to interact with
  chain: zora,
  transport: http(),
});

const mintClient = createMintClient({ chain: zora });

// prepare the mint transaction, which can be simulated via an rpc with the public client.
const prepared = await mintClient.makePrepareMintTokenParams({
  // 1155 contract address
  tokenAddress,
  tokenId,
  mintArguments: {
    // address that will receive the minted tokens
    mintToAddress,
    // quantity of tokens to mint
    quantityToMint,
  },
  // account to execute the mint transaction
  minterAccount,
});

// simulate the transaction
const { request } = await publicClient.simulateContract(prepared);
```
