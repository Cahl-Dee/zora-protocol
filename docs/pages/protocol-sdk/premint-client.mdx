## Gasslessly Create 1155 Tokens (Premint)

The Protocol SDK can be used to gaslessly gaslessly create 1155 contracts and tokens, aka Premints, and collect them, using the `PremintClient`
Premints are created/updated/deleted by signing a message and uploading them to the Zora Premint API. Signing, uploading, and fetching Premints
can be be done via the `PremintClient`.

### Setup/Create the PremintClient

Initialize a Premint Client with a chain.

```ts twoslash
import { createPremintClient } from "@zoralabs/protocol-sdk";
import { zora } from "viem/chains";

const premintClient = createPremintClient({ chain: zora }); // [!code focus]
```

### Creating

The function `createPremint` build and signs a premint, then submits it to a Zora API so it
can be retrieved later to mint. Minting a premint brings the contract and token onchain if
it hasn't been brought onchain yet.

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]
```

### Collecting

Once a Premint has been created and submitted to the Zora Premint API, it can be collected by calling `collectPremint` with the premint's contract address and uid.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: create.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/collect.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [create.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]
```

### Updating

**Before a Premint is brought onchain,** it can be updated by the original creator of that token, by having that creator sign a message indicating the update.
This signature and updated premint is then submitted to the Zora Premint API and replaces the existing stored premint for the token
with the same uid.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: create.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/update.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [create.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]
```

### Deleting

**Before a premint is brought onchain,** it can be deleted by the original creator of that token, by having that creator sign a message indicating that
the premint should be deleted.
This signature and deleted premint is then submitted to the Zora Premint API and causes the API to no longer return that premint.

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [example.ts]
// @filename: config.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]

// @filename: create.ts
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]

// @filename: example.ts
// ---cut---
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/delete.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [create.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/create.ts]
```

```ts twoslash [config.ts]
// [!include ~/snippets/protocol-sdk/premint/config.ts]
```
